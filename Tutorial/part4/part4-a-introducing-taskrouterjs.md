# Control Worker Activities using TaskRouter.js: Introducing TaskRouter.js

TaskRouter's TaskRouter.js library enables you to easily add Worker Activity controls and event notifications to your web user interfaces.

TaskRouter.js provides methods for changing the Activity of a Worker. It also provides event callbacks that allow you to subscribe to important events and state changes on your Worker directly from a Web based client. Communication to the TaskRouter infrastructure is handled via a WebSocket connection managed by TaskRouter.js

For details, refer to the [complete documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/taskrouter-js-overview) for TaskRouter.js

In the next step, we'll add a realtime "Agent" user interface - a highly simplified Web page that allows our Worker Alice to control her current Activity State, see when her Activity state has changed, and see information about new incoming calls.
