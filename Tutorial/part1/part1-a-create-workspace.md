# Setting up a TaskRouter Workspace: Create a Workspace

A Workspace is the container element for any TaskRouter application.

Every element of a TaskRouter Workspace (including the Workspace itself) can be created using the REST API or the [TaskRouter console](https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/dashboard). For simplicity, in this tutorial we will use the portal.

[Create a Workspace](https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/workspaces) and give it a name (as below). For the template, choose 'Standard Workspace'. Leave the Event Callback URL blank:

![create - workspace](./images/create_workspace.png)

That was easy! For the rest of Part 1, we'll be adding necessary elements to our new Workspace so we can start routing Tasks in Part 2.
