# Setting up a TaskRouter Workspace: Wrapping Up

We're ready to create Tasks and watch as TaskRouter assigns them to our Workers!

Our sample business domain is extremely simple, leveraging just one dimension (language) to differentiate both Tasks and Workers. As you create more advanced TaskRouter applications, you will appreciate the flexibility that TaskRouter's many-to-many Task-to-Worker matching model provides.

In Part 2, we create Tasks using the TaskRouter REST API and observe the Task assignment lifecycle.
